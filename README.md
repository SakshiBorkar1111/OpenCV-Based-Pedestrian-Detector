# Pedestrian Detection in Video using OpenCV
A computer vision project that detects pedestrians in videos using OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade, featuring real-time visualization and processed video output.


## Overview: 
This project detects pedestrians in videos using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier. Each frame of the input video is processed to identify pedestrians, draw bounding boxes around them, and save the full processed video as output. This can be applied in surveillance, traffic monitoring, and smart city projects.

## Business Problem: 
Monitoring pedestrian movement in public spaces is essential for safety, traffic management, and urban planning. Manual observation is labor-intensive and error-prone. Automating pedestrian detection allows authorities to efficiently track pedestrian activity, prevent accidents, and make data-driven decisions.

## Features: 
- Reads an input video file.
- Detects pedestrians frame by frame using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected pedestrians.
- Saves the processed video to the working directory.
- Can optionally show the video with detected pedestrians while processing.

## Conclusion / Result
The project successfully detects pedestrians in videos and highlights them with bounding boxes. The processed video can be used for further analysis in surveillance systems, traffic monitoring, or urban planning applications. This automated approach reduces manual effort, increases accuracy, and provides a visual record of pedestrian activity over time.
